# ClassicAlgorithmsJavaScript

<p>This project will contain implementations of various classic data
structures and algorithms in JavaScript.  The intention here is to
practice the following: (1) good programing techniques, (2) idiomatic
JavaScript, (3) object-oriented techniques in JavaScript, and (4) use
of the algorithms and data structures themselves.</p>

<p>For Number (1) above, good programming techniques, we are influenced
primarily by Martin's <i>Clean Code</i>.  We are interested in writing
code that is <em>comprehensible to humans</em>.  This includes 
extensive unit testing.  Unit tests are implemented using the Jasmine
framework.</p>

<p>For the idiomatic JavaScript
per se, we are influenced by the <em>good parts</em> of Crockford's
<i>JavaScript: the Good Parts</i>&mdash;that is, we take the parts of his
teachings that make sense and reject much of his opinion when it does not.
In particular, we do not care
about passing Crockford's JSLint test, and no effort will be made to do
that.</p>

<p>In line with the goals stated above, our implementations of the 
data structures and algorithms are not necessarily written for optimized
performance.  The intention is to write with almost mathematical 
precision.  The code will be written as to make proofs of correctness
easy.
